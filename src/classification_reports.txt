Classification Reports:
The classification report shows the following metrics for each class:
- Precision: The ability of the classifier not to label a negative sample as positive.
- Recall: The ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples.
- F1-score: A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric for both.
- Support: The number of samples per class.

Note: Accuracy is not included in the classification report by default.
Accuracy is the ratio of correctly classified samples to the total number of samples.

The report also includes two types of averages:
- Weighted Average (weighted avg): Calculates the average metric by weighting the metric of each class by its support (number of samples).
  This gives more importance to the metrics of classes with a larger number of samples.
- Macro Average (macro avg): Calculates the arithmetic mean of the metric values across all classes, treating each class equally.
  This does not consider the number of samples per class.
